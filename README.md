# userdashboard
Greetings! This project is going to be built upon onto two other repositories; user-authentication, responsivenav, and userdashboard (current).
-
In this repository, the main functions include signing in using email/password with firebase, the ability to make an account in the app, routing and personalized greeting. The purpose of this app is to make a CUTE platform for photographers to share and display their nature photography.

Auther's note: I used a youtube video as a guideline and for some tips HOWEVER I used my own logic and design choices to fit this project's requirements.

TO START:
    1. In your terminal, type "cd userauth"
    2. Still in the terminal, type "npm start"
    3. Then to access the dashboard, click the Log In button to be redirected to the log in page.
    4. If you do not have an account already, in the log in page, there will be a link that says "Don't have an account? Create one here". Clicking that will redirect you to a page to create an account.
    5. After creating an account, it will take you back into the log in page.
    6. Once logged in, you will be taken to the Dashboard page which is the endpoint of this project.
